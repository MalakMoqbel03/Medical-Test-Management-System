# Medical-Test-Management-System
 Develop a system in MIPS assembly to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve medical test data for individual patients. This system acts as a basic patient record management system focusing on test results.
Objective:
Develop a system in MIPS assembly to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve medical test data for
individual patients. This system acts as a basic patient record management system focusing on test
results.
File Format:
The medical test will be stored in text file. Each line in the text file represents a single medical test. The
representation will include fields for:
• Patient ID (integer: 7 digits)
• Test name (string - consider a fixed length)
• Test date (string - fixed format like YYYY-MM)
• Result (floating-point value)
For example, the following file has two medical tests:
1300500: RBC, 2024-03, 13.5
1300511: LDL, 2024-03, 110
Medical Tests:
Below is the list of medical tests with their normal range:
1. Hemoglobin (Hgb): 13.8 to 17.2 grams per deciliter
2. Blood Glucose Test (BGT): Normal Range Between 70 to 99 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL)
3. LDL Cholesterol Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL): Normal Range Less than 100 mg/dL
4. Blood Pressure Test (BPT): Normal Range: Systolic Blood Pressure: Less than 120 millimeters of
mercury (mm Hg). Diastolic Blood Pressure: Less than 80 mm Hg
System Functionality:
Develop a text-based menu that allows users to:
• Add a new medical test: the system will allow the user to store a new medical test with the
required data. The system will check the validity of the input data.
• Search for a test by patient ID: the system will have the following functionality based on user
selection:
• Retrieve all patient tests
• Retrieve all up normal patient tests
• Retrieve all patient tests in a given specific period
• Searching for unnormal tests: the system will retrieve all up normal patients’ tests based on the
input medical test.
• Average test value: the system will retrieve the average value of each medical test
• Update an existing test result
• Delete a test
In addition to the above functionality, the system has capability for:
• Error Handling: Implement error handling for invalid file name, searching for non-existent tests,
searching for non-existent patient, ….
• Data Validation: Validate user input to ensure proper data types (e.g., integers for ID, valid
dates) and handle potential errors.
